    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a tutorial on how to make a <strong>super easy</strong> and <strong>addictively delicious</strong> creamy tomato pasta with Italian sausage, <em>in just 20 minutes!</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Passata (tomato puree)</li>
            <li>Mascarpone</li>
            <li>Dried Pasta (in any shape you prefer)</li>
            <li>Italian Sausages</li>
            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>Garlic & oregano</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the sausages</strong>: you'll want to remove the sausages from their casing so they can be easily broken up whilst browning. Once browned, add the garlic and oregano until fragrant then add the wine and reduce by half. </li>
            <li><strong>Add the passata</strong>: add the tomato passata and simmer for 3-5 minutes then add the mascarpone, stir until melted.</li>
            <li><strong>Add pasta</strong>: add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. The time will depend on the pasta shape you use so check the packet instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer sauce</strong>: continue to simmer the sauce until the pasta is cooked. Transfer the pasta to the sauce either with a slotted spoon or drain it first (make sure to reserve some pasta water!).</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>: add the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and stir into the sauce with the pasta until fully coated. Add a splash or two of pasta water if needed. Serve topped with more cheese. </li>
        </ol>
