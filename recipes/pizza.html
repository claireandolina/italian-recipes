    <h1>Neapolitan Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <img src = "../images/pizza.jpg">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a tutorial on how to make a simple Neapolitan-style pizza you can make at home, inspired by the <em> best pizza in Naples Italy!</em> </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball Best Homemade Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Easy Pizza Saucepices</li>
            <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Pasta sauce</li>
            <li>2 basil leaves</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong> using the <a href = "https://www.acouplecooks.com/pizza-dough-recipe/"> Best Pizza Dough Recipe</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat pizza oven to 500 deg. F</strong>, making sure to place a <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/whats-the-best-pizza-stone/">pizza stone</a> in the oven.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the <a href = "https://www.acouplecooks.com/pizza-sauce-recipe/"> Homemade Pizza Sauce</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Slice the mozzarella</strong> into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>Stretch the dough into a circle</strong> when the oven is ready. Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top. Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese.  Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the basil leaves</strong> if you are baking in a pizza oven. For baking in a standard oven, add the basil leaves after you bake (the leaves turn black in a standard oven).</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone</strong> on the pizza peel, then bake until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
